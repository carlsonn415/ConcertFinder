## üöÄ Technologies and Architecture

LineUp is built with a focus on modern Android development practices, leveraging the following key technologies and architectural principles:

  * **Kotlin:** The primary programming language for Android development.
  * **Jetpack Compose:** Android's modern toolkit for building native UI.
  * **Retrofit:** A type-safe HTTP client for Android to consume the Ticketmaster Discovery API.
  * **GSON:** Used for serializing and deserializing JSON data from the API responses.
  * **Room Persistence Library:** For local data storage, including caching and saving user-favorite events.
  * **Ticketmaster Discovery API:** The primary source for concert and event data.
  * **Google Maps API:** Allows users to see where events are located without leaving the app.
  * **Google Geocoding Library:** To convert location names into geographical coordinates for event searches.
  * **Hilt:** For robust and scalable dependency injection, ensuring a modular and testable codebase.
  * **Clean Architecture:** The project follows a clean architecture approach, separating concerns into data, domain, and presentation layers.
  * **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):** The architectural pattern used for building a reactive and maintainable UI.
  * **Kotlin Coroutines:** Allows the UI to stay responsive while separate threads handle network requests.
  * **Android Studio:** The official IDE for Android development.
  * **Gradle:** Build automation tool.

## üì± Installation and Setup

To get LineUp running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash

3.  **Add API Keys and configure gradle:**
      * You'll need a **Ticketmaster Discovery API Key** and a **Google Maps Platform API Key**.
      * Create a `secrets.properties` file in the root directory and add your key like this (example):
        ```properties
        TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=YOUR_TICKETMASTER_API_KEY
        MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_MAPS_API_KEY
        ```
      * *Note: Ensure your key is not committed to your public repository for security reasons.*
4.  **Sync Gradle:**
      * Android Studio should automatically sync the Gradle project. If not, click `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files`.
5.  **Run on Device/Emulator:**
      * Connect an Android device to your computer with USB debugging enabled, or set up an Android Emulator.
      * Select your target device/emulator from the toolbar.
      * Click the `Run` button (green triangle) to build and install the app.
